      "response": "## Executive Summary\r\nThe Hanford Mall solar project has inconsistent nameplate capacity values across different documents, ranging from 1.58746 MW DC to 1.669.57 MW DC. The most frequently referenced value is 1.669.57 MW DC, appearing in multiple financial documents, while the EPC Agreement specifically defines the Solar System as having a nameplate capacity of 1.58746 MW DC. These discrepancies suggest potential revisions to the project scope or documentation errors that could impact financial projections and regulatory compliance.\r\n\r\nThe documents show several different nameplate capacity values for the Hanford Mall solar project, with the most significant discrepancy between the EPC Agreement's 1.58746 MWDC [6a04147] and the financial documents' 1.669.57 MW DC [1bfc039], [7391623]. Building permits show two arrays (784.74 kW and 802.72 kW) that sum to 1,587.46 kW, which aligns closely with the EPC Agreement value. The O&M Agreement lists 1,625.76 kW [4c22f8f], while the Independent Engineering Review mentions both 1,587 kW (current) and 1,637 kW (proposed) [8879947].",
